_An Intellectual History of Automatic Differentiation_ traces the
research surrounding a collection of techniques for computing
derivatives without using either approximation or the manipulation of
subscript-filled equations used to terrorize high school
students. While its simplicity gives this method the mystery of "deep
magic," it has its roots in work on differential equations in the late
19th century; inspired Alonzo Church's discovery of the untyped lambda
calculus; influenced the development of functional programming,
concurrency, and Unix in the 1970s; and has been recently rediscovered
with applications to type theory, modelling stochastic processes, and
training recurrent neural networks.
